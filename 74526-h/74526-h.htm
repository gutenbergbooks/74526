  <h2 class='c004'>THE SOLAR WAVE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>What a warm day it was! The sun beat down
till everything was baking hot out of doors, and indoors
it was nearly as bad.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina wandered about, up-stairs and down, and
finally opened the parlor door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the coolest place yet,” she said. The
shutters were closed, so the hot sun did not find its
way in there. There was an odor of new matting
and fresh flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina picked up a fan that was lying on the
table, threw herself down on the sofa, and began
fanning herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My, how warm I am!” she said. “I believe
it’s just the hottest day that ever was. Maria said
you could bake bread on the roof.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>She kept on fanning herself, once in a while
opening and shutting the fan, which was quite a
pretty one, and Tina found herself counting the
slats and looking at the decorations on them, till
suddenly a little face appeared, peeping at her from
the center slat of the fan, and as the fan waved
back and forth, the little white face seemed to be
bowing and bowing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder where that little girl came from?”
thought Tina; “she wasn’t here a minute ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I was,” said a voice, “only you didn’t
see me. I was folded up in the fan, and when you
waved the fan, I came out with the breeze.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s queer,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time the little face had grown larger
and larger, and presently a whole little girl stood
beside her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t it warm?” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not so very, in here,” said the little girl;
“but I will take you to a warm place;” and before
Tina could say a word, she was seized by the hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>and found herself running swiftly along. She
looked up at the little girl, who grew taller and
taller, and by the time they had stopped running,
she was a tall young maiden.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come,” said she, as she opened a door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina went in. There was a smell of bread-baking,
and just as they entered Tina saw a baker
taking loaves of bread out of an oven.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never was in a bake-shop before like this,”
thought Tina. “I am glad I can see how they
make bread, and bake it;” and she stood still to
watch the baker.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had a long shovel with which he was drawing
the bread out of the oven; and just at that moment
Tina saw him start back, and there, stepping
on the shovel, was a little black imp. It grinned at the
baker, and the baker stood still and stared back at it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are you?” said he. “Where did you
come from?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I came from the oven,” said the imp. “I’ve
been in there for a week.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“No wonder he is so black,” thought Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, where are you going?” said the baker.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_010.jpg' alt='[Baker]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“I am going to the king’s palace,” said the imp.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“Oho! I’d like to see you,” said the baker.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, see me, then,” said the imp, as he
jumped down and ran to the door, shouting, “Hurrah
for King Caloric!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, come quickly! it is the king’s son,” said
the maiden, seizing Tina by the hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they ran out of the door, and as they
went, Tina saw the figure of the imp ahead of
them grow larger and larger, until they came to
an open field where the sun was shining brightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the first sunbeam struck the imp,
he changed into a tall prince, with a golden crown
on his head; but he looked thin and pale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently a flock of twelve geese appeared, and
one of them followed the prince, gently pulling his
coat, till he turned round to look at it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then it ran on ahead until it came to a little
brook, near to which a tree was growing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The prince followed it, and taking off his crown,
he hung it on the tree; then he lay down by the
brook and went to sleep, while the goose crouched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>down beside him, and the eleven other geese stayed
a little distance off, none of them allowing a soul
to pass them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina looked around, and saw in the distance
what at first she thought was a pile of very bright
clouds, but, as she looked, she saw that it was a palace,
that glittered as if made of sunlight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is where King Caloric lives,” said her
companion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just then two men passed, going different ways.
One was carrying a lamp that twinkled like a star,
and the other had two or three vessels from which
smoke seemed to come, as if there were fire inside.</p>

<p class='c008'>They both looked in the direction of the sleeping
prince, and one of them said to the other:</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is heat?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The sensation of warmth,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is caloric?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A subtle, invisible fluid,” and his voice died
away.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“What on earth do they say ‘Familiar Science’
for?” said Tina.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_013.jpg' alt='[Boy]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Hush!” said the maiden.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“The Solar Wave,” said the men, looking over
at the prince; and they passed on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the oddest place I ever saw,” said
Tina; but as she looked up at her companion, she
saw that the tears were running down her cheeks,
and she stooped down and kissed Tina on the forehead.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she said, “Keep fifty yards behind me,
and you will be safe.” And leaving Tina, she
went toward the sleeping prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>The geese stood aside and let her pass on.</p>

<p class='c008'>She knelt down by the brook, and taking some
water up in the hollow of her hand, she dropped a
drop on each of the prince’s eyelids.</p>

<p class='c008'>He awoke with a start, and looked at her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is time,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took her by the hand, and they walked off
together. The geese all marched to the brink of
the brook, and stood there till they were out of
sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina followed them till they came to a city.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>She was careful to keep fifty yards behind them.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_015.jpg' alt='[Couple]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As they went on, the streets became very narrow,
the houses nearer together and crowded with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>people who looked from the windows and doors,
and sat in the streets outside.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the prince and the maiden came up to them,
they seemed very much afraid and distressed, and
once the pair stopped, and the maiden said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do not be afraid, my good people; the prince
is on his way to his father’s house, and he must
come this way. It will only be for a little while.”
But as she looked at a woman holding a little sick
child, she began to sob, and hurried on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina could not imagine what was the matter,
until she noticed that it grew warmer and warmer,
and the people could hardly breathe for the heat.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a while they came to the gates of the palace,
and, for the first time, Tina saw that the prince
did not have on his crown. He must have left it
hanging on the tree, she thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they went through the gates there was a
great noise of trumpets. Everything seemed to be
blazing with light and heat.</p>

<p class='c008'>They went on from hall to hall. Just before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>they were to go into the last one, some one handed
the prince a harp.</p>

<p class='c008'>He carried this with him into a large room.
At the end of this room sat a king on a throne.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that King Caloric?” asked Tina of the
maiden, who had left the prince and was standing
by her side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she replied. “Listen!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The prince went up to the foot of the throne,
where a seat was ready for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everything was as still as could be. There
were a great many persons standing about, but it
was as silent as noonday, and there was the same
feeling in the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently in came the twelve geese, the first
one with the prince’s crown on its head. They
stopped some distance from the throne, and the
prince began to play.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he played, Tina saw the oven and the
baker, the field and the brook, the narrow streets,
and everything.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Everyone looked very grave, and the king listened.
It seemed as if the prince were telling all
that had happened, and yet he was only playing on
his harp.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will do. It is not so bad,” said the king,
when he had finished.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is all my good Breeze,” said the prince;
“but for her, there would have been a sad tale to
tell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is she?” asked the king.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a little rustle, and Tina saw the
maiden glide forward and stand by the prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go, my children,” said the king; “the world
will be glad to see you together, and I hope your
dear Breeze will grow stronger, for the world’s
sake,” he said to the prince. “I see now that it
would not do to part you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then there was a sound of rushing wings. Tina
felt a cool air blowing on her face; the palace, the
prince, and all seemed to melt away, and she was
looking around the parlor to find that a shutter on
the shady side of the room had blown open, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>quite a breeze was blowing. She picked up the
fan, but the little girl’s face was gone, and it looked
just as it did before.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE FROG.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>She commenced fanning herself again, still
wondering about the prince and King Caloric, and
looking at the fan, in hopes the little face would
appear again.</p>

<p class='c008'>And in a few moments something did seem to
be coming out on another slat; and as Tina looked,
she saw it was a face, but not the same one she
had seen before.</p>

<p class='c008'>This one was laughing, and the more it laughed
the wider the mouth became, and the broader the
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is the funniest looking thing I ever
saw,” thought Tina, as she watched it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The face grew and grew, and in a few minutes
a body appeared; that, too, swelled and swelled.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
<img src='images/i_021.jpg' alt='[Frogs]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“It looks like a frog,” said Tina, and just as
she said this, hop went the figure into the middle
of the floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a frog,” said Tina; and sure enough, there
it stood on its hind legs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I never,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Knee-deep,” said the frog.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did you say?” asked Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bottle o’ rum,” said the frog.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s funny talk,” she said; and as she
spoke the frog went hopping out of the door, and
the first thing she knew, she was hopping after him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe I’m a frog, too,” she thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>They went hopping along, till they came to a
marshy stream.</p>

<p class='c008'>The frog sat down, and said, “Knee-deep!”
when up hopped another frog and almost knocked
Tina over.</p>

<p class='c008'>It laid its hand on its stomach, and began to
sing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Come, come, come,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Come to the marsh so green,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Where reeds and rushes grow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And turtles gay are seen.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The big frog pointed to Tina, and, making one
leap, jumped into the water. The other frog
jumped in after him, and Tina was left alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a few moments the big frog came up to the
surface and began to sing, in a hoarse voice:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“Down, down, down,</div>
      <div class='line'>Down in the water cold,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Down in the water clear;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here is my hand, take hold,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Come, come with me, my dear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! I don’t want to go,” said Tina. “I don’t
like to be a frog.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you must,” said the frog; and he reached
up his hand and drew her down, “plump” into
the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>But just as she was going, she found it wasn’t
the water at all, that she had only rolled off the
sofa. So she got up and began to fan again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE SUNSET LAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“How stupid of me to roll off the sofa,” said
Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anyhow, I am glad I am not a frog. I do
think this is the strangest fan I ever saw. I wouldn’t
be surprised to see anything come out of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fan wafted a soft breeze back and forth,
and Tina forgot to look for the little faces on it,
she was so comfortable, till she heard a voice
say:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, go into the woods with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who’s that?” said Tina, looking at the fan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is I,” said the voice. “Don’t you see me?
I won’t come out, unless you say you will go to the
woods with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, I will go,” said Tina; “if we don’t
have to go through the sun—it is so hot.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
<img src='images/i_025.jpg' alt='[Couple]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“It will be pleasant, where we are going,” said
the voice; and then Tina saw a little boy’s face appear
on the fan.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was a very pretty little boy, and as he said
“Come,” Tina put down the fan, and there was
the boy standing by her side.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took her by the hand, and suddenly she
found herself with him on a broad terrace, in front
of a beautiful house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did we get here?” said Tina. “This
isn’t my home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but it is one of mine,” said the little boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina looked about her, as they walked down the
steps of the marble terrace, and saw a lovely scene
spread out before her.</p>

<p class='c008'>All about were vases of flowers, and clumps of
shrubbery. At the foot of the steps there was a
garden with sparkling fountains, shady walks, statues
peeping out here and there, and beyond a dense
forest.</p>

<p class='c008'>The air was mild, and everything looked well-cared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>for, but not a creature was to be seen; and it
was as still as could be.</p>

<p class='c008'>They went on toward the forest, and as they entered
it, Tina saw flowers everywhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do let us get some,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” said the boy. “I will get you a
basket;” and, turning a little out of the path, he
went to a tree, and Tina saw that from every limb
baskets were hanging, as if they grew there.</p>

<p class='c008'>He came back with one for Tina, and as she
thanked him, she said: “You haven’t told me your
name.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name,” said he, “is Sunny Summer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a queer name!” said Tina, “but I rather
like it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went on, and Tina filled her basket with
blossoms. They were the most beautiful she had
ever seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sunny climbed trees for her, and helped her
find the finest colors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon they came to a bridge.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“Take off your hat, and throw it in,” said
Sunny.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the water?” said Tina. “What for?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You cannot go over, unless you do,” said he.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Tina took off her hat, and threw it in the
water. Sunny did the same with his, and they
went bareheaded over the bridge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now we can go to the Sunset Land,” said he;
“but we couldn’t have gone in our old hats, for we
never would have reached there alive. We will
get new ones directly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As they reached the other side of the bridge,
Sunny went to a big hollow tree, and tapped on
the bark, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sun, Sun, Sun,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The day is not done,</div>
      <div class='line'>What have you for me,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A bonnet or none?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>And at once a hand appeared, holding out a pink
sunbonnet.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
<img src='images/i_029.jpg' alt='[Couple]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Sunny
took it, and
gave it to
Tina. She
put it on,
and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>went along a little further till they came to another
hollow tree. Sunny tapped again on that, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sun, Sun, Sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>The day is not done;</div>
      <div class='line'>What have you for two,</div>
      <div class='line'>A hat old or new?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>And a hand appeared with a hat in it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sunny put it on, and they went on till they
came to the foot of a hill.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here they sat down and arranged the flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Must we go up that steep hill?” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Sunny; “we shall see the Sunset
Land from the top of it. We had better start now,
or we will not get there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So he put his arm around Tina, and they trudged
up the hill. When they reached the top, he
pointed to the sky, where the sun was going down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is the Sunset Land!” said he—“the
beautiful Sunset Land! See the rivers, and temples
and the people in their rose-colored robes.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
<img src='images/i_031.jpg' alt='[Chase]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“I never knew it was really a place,” said Tina;
“but now I see that it is. How beautiful the gold
is, and the purple. Let us hurry; I want to see
it nearer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So they started down hill, and the Sunset Land
faded from their sight as they went on.</p>

<p class='c008'>It grew chilly, and they came to another forest.
This seemed full of life. There were whiskings to
and fro, chatterings up in the trees, rustlings among
the branches, and now and then Tina heard a
laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina clung close to Sunny, and said, “I am
afraid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you needn’t be,” he said. “You mustn’t
be afraid of anything you see, for you are perfectly
safe now that you have your sunbonnet on;
as soon as they see that, they will know who you
are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Just then two beasts came dashing along. The
first was a deer, and after it came a wolf, while another
started up from among some bushes. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>all rushed along, but the deer was ahead; and in a
moment all three were out of sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is the matter?” asked Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are in a hurry to get to Sunset Land
before the sun goes down. The deer has despatches
for China, and the wolf wants to get them
away from him, so they won’t go off,” said Sunny.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Politics, I suppose,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said he.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t the least idea what politics are,” said
Tina, “but it sounds something like that, when
papa talks to Mr. Wright, and mamma says it is
politics.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently they saw, not far off, what at first
looked like the stump of a tree; but, on coming
up to it, Tina saw it was an old woman, all huddled
up. She had a quantity of leaves spread
out before her, and she was saying, over and
over:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Turn to red and turn to gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though we’re young, we must be old.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“What is she doing?” whispered Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Getting the leaves ready to turn,” said Sunny.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know what that means. It means I must
be going.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina couldn’t imagine what he meant, but she
followed him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am getting very tired,” she said. “When
will we get to Sunset Land?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will not be long, now,” said Sunny. “We
will see the sentinel soon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe I can go any further,” said
Tina, “unless I rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just a few moments,” said Sunny, kindly.
“When we come in sight of the sentinel, we will
be all right, and can rest as long as we want to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They walked a few yards, and in among the
bushes Tina spied a man standing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There he is,” said Sunny, and he sat down
under a large tree.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina threw herself down beside him, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>drew her head down on his lap; she took hold of
his hand, and in a few moments was fast asleep.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE ROSE GARDEN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Tina thought she had slept some time when
she heard a voice singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I must go, I must go,</div>

      <div class='line'>Where the golden rivers</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“Fare you well! Fare you well!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I must go, ’tis late;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I see opened wide,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The sunlit gate</div>
      <div class='line'>Of that beautiful land,</div>

      <div class='line'>With their robes wind-blown,</div>

      <div class='line in4'>Dream, Tina, dreams</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Of those golden gleams.</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Think of me,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>When you see</div>
      <div class='line in12'>The Sunset Land.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But it was some time before she could wake up
at all, and then she saw that the little boy had
gone, and she was lying with the fan in her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t remember having this with me,” she
said; “but I suppose I must have taken it, or it
wouldn’t be here. I wonder where Sunny has
gone; it is too bad I couldn’t get to the Sunset
Land after all. That must have been he singing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to me. But how this fan came here is a mystery
to me. There is another face, of course. I knew
it. I wonder how this is going to turn out? It
looks like a girl, but I’m not so sure that it is. It
has a ruffle around its neck—no it isn’t a ruffle. I
believe it has wings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The wings fluttered, and something flew out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, you’re a butterfly,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know it,” said the creature. “You might
as well say to a horse, you’re a horse. Everybody
knows I am a butterfly. I don’t see anything so
very peculiar in my being a butterfly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you needn’t be so snappish,” said Tina.
“I didn’t suppose you were going to take my head
off. I’m sorry I spoke.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, well, come along,” said the butterfly;
and Tina was amazed at finding herself flying
through the air after the butterfly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should like to know what I am,” she
thought; “but I don’t dare ask any questions—the
butterfly has such an unpleasant manner.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>
<img src='images/i_039.jpg' alt='[Birds]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>They went flying along, and presently Tina
heard the rushing of wings behind, and she saw
they were joined by four birds; one of them flew
close by Tina. “I wonder if I am a bird?”
thought she. “I believe I will ask. Am I a bird?”
she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a question!” answered the bird; “as if
you didn’t know. How could you fly, if you were
not a bird?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I might be a butterfly,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you might,” said the bird. “I never
thought of that; but you are not, all the same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then, I suppose I must be a bird,” thought
Tina. “I am glad I know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was delightful to go skimming along through
the air, and Tina came to the conclusion that to
be a bird was better than to be a little girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are we going?” she asked the bird,
who was flying by her side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one but the butterfly knows,” said the
bird.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Pretty soon they came to a forest. “I can go
no further with you,” said the butterfly. “I must
go find the rose before its petals drop. If you
reach the snow in time, turn around and come
back! I will be there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then it flew away, and Tina and the other birds
went on into the forest. As they went on, they
heard sounds of distress, and they saw among the
branches of a tree two birds whose nest had been
overturned, and the eggs broken. They all gathered
around, and asked the pair what had happened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He has been here,” said they, chirping pitifully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come with us,” said the birds. “We are
going to the North Country, and we can find
him. After that we will all be happy in the Rose
Garden.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So the birds went with them, and they all rose
up over the tops of the trees, and flew through the
air to the north.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>It grew colder and colder. Every now and
then other birds would join them, when they heard
where they were going; and by the time they
reached the snow there was a large flock of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina wondered what they were all going to do,
when they all settled down on the snow-covered
ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were buildings and trees about; and
after a great deal of chattering, some of them flew
up on the branches, and others on different places,
where they all seemed to be waiting for something.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally, they all looked at each other, and said,
“Here he comes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina looked too, and saw a strange creature
coming toward them. It looked something like a
cat, and something like a snake. She could not
tell which it was.</p>

<p class='c008'>At once there was a great flutter and stir
among the birds, and they all flew furiously at the
creature.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
<img src='images/i_043.jpg' alt='[Birds]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Tina thought it must be the one that had ruined
the eggs, as she saw the pair of birds whose nest it
was, seeming very angry.</p>

<p class='c008'>She joined the others, and they began to battle
with the creature, who was so taken by surprise that
it did not know what to do.</p>

<p class='c008'>They pecked at its eyes, they beat it with their
wings. At last they all flew up on a tree, and
looked at Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What am I to do?” she said. “You seem
to expect something of me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Finish it!” said they. “Finish it!” they all
screamed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How can I?” said she.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know,” they said. “You know best;
go on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina stood still for a moment, and then she
picked up a little twig, and flew toward the beast.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seemed to be greatly afraid when it saw her,
and as she waved the twig before its eyes, it sank
back and closed them.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
<img src='images/i_045.jpg' alt='[Birds]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>There was a scream of delight from the birds,
and they all gathered around her twittering and
singing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, to the Rose Garden,” said they, and
they flew off, with Tina in their midst.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they went on, the air grew warm and
balmy, and the perfume of flowers became stronger.
Soon they saw a row of marble pillars, white as
snow.</p>

<p class='c008'>They all alighted, and the butterfly flew toward
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have done well,” it said to Tina. “Welcome
to the Rose Garden.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina looked around and saw that she was in
the most enchanting place. Myriads of beautiful
birds flew about; butterflies of every hue darted
here and there, and there were roses—roses everywhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seemed like Fairy-land; and Tina thought
it must be, when she saw she still had the fan, and
a little fairy face was looking at her from another
slat.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE FAIRY’S FRIENDS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“I thought I was a bird,” said Tina, “and
birds don’t carry fans.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were a bird, but you’re not one now,”
said the fairy. “You touched the rose before its
petals fell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When did I touch it?” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fairy pointed to a rosebush by which
Tina was sitting, and she saw that one rose leaf
lay on her lap; it had just dropped from a lovely
rose that rested by her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you came from the fan, too?” she said
to the fairy, who picked up the rose leaf and began
to fan herself with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said the fairy, “I am one of the Zephyrs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you are very pretty,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know it,” said the fairy. “At least most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>people think so. Now, I will take you to see some
friends of mine, if you would like to go,” said she;
“but you will not see me after we leave the Rose
Garden.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How will I know your friends, when I see
them, and how can I find the way?” asked Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I will be there,” said the fairy, “to tell
you; only you can’t see me. I will give you a book
to look at before we go, and if anything should
possibly happen, you have only to look in the book,
and it will be all plain to you. Sit there
under that tree, and I will come for you in a moment.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina sat down and took the book in her lap,
and began to look at it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a very queer book, full of pictures which,
when you looked close at them, seemed not to be
pictures merely, but the places themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina was puzzling over them when the fairy
came back.</p>

<p class='c008'>They passed through the Rose Garden, all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>roses nodding to them, and
the butterflies flying about
their heads to the very
gate.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_049.jpg' alt='[Girl]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As they passed through
the gate, the fairy disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are you?”
asked Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am right here beside
you,” said a voice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“Go on straight ahead till you come to an open
space, where you will see some gray hares feeding.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not long before Tina spied the hares.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, where shall I go?” said she.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep on to that old tree with gnarly roots.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She did so, and sat down under the tree, wondering
what was coming next.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently up hopped four hares, and sat down
in front of her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said she.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said they.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a fine day,” said Tina, not knowing exactly
what to say.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hares looked at each other as much as to
say, “She is very silly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course it is a fine day,” said one of them.
“Did you think we couldn’t see?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Tina, “I only wanted to be polite.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,” said the hare, “I’m glad I know.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Tina put her hand in her pocket and found a
piece of bread, which she thought she would give
to the hares.</p>

<p class='c008'>They hopped to her and began to quiver their
noses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t you have a piece?” said she.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?” asked they.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only bread.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is that? We never saw any before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is very good,” she replied. “You had better
try it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One of them began to nibble it, but while he
was eating he began to turn from gray to black,
and at once they all hopped away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina got up and followed them. “Where is
the fairy, I wonder?” she said, looking around.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here I am,” said a voice over her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked up and saw a bird, but that was
all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look at your book,” said the voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina looked at her book and saw a path leading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>to a fence. A gun was leaning by the fence,
and a dead hare was lying on its back near by.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think I’ll go there,” she said. “Need
I?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said the fairy. “You can go the other
way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned the page of her book and saw a
path leading toward a village, and as she shut the
book, there was the path before her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned into it, and as she walked on she
heard merry voices, that seemed to come nearer
and nearer. She looked to the right and left, but
saw no one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must be children in the village,” she
thought. “I will keep on. It sounds as if they
were having a pretty good time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A few yards from her she saw two squirrels
sitting up, eating nuts, and when she came up to
them a nut fell right on the top of her head, and
she heard a little laugh somewhere above her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked up, and there, in the branches of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>tree, were three or four little children gathering
nuts.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come up,” they said. “You don’t know
what fun it is!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shall I go?” said Tina to the fairy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she said. “These are my friends. My
father, the West Wind, is coming to-night to blow
down the nuts, and the squirrels will get them all;
it is their tree, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina went up to the tree, and was going to
climb up, when suddenly she felt herself lifted off
her feet, and before she could turn around she was
sitting on a limb of the tree, with three children
near her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have been waiting for you ever so long,”
said they. “What made you so late?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I stopped to talk to the hares,” said she. “I
didn’t know you were waiting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Just then a squirrel whisked by them, stopping
to look over his shoulder at them, and saying,
“Don’t take too many.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
<img src='images/i_055.jpg' alt='[Girl]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“We won’t,” said they.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never knew squirrels and such things could
talk,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>The children laughed, and said, “You must
have lived in a funny place all your life, if you
never heard squirrels talk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was a very nice place,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps so,” said the children. “Never mind;
let us get down, and see what is in the nuts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, what is always in nuts, I suppose,” said
Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you don’t know,” said they; and they all
gave a little jump, and sank lightly to the ground
as if they were feathers.</p>

<p class='c008'>They set to work to crack the nuts, and Tina
was amazed to find that in every one was something
different.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first one held a delicious bon-bon; the
second a tiny little horse and wagon. The horse
seemed alive and trotted off by itself, no one tried
to stop it. And nut after nut was cracked, each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>holding something more wonderful—the strange
part of it being that no amount of hard blows on
the shell seemed to break what was inside.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a while they were tired; and, taking
Tina by the hand, led her to the village, through
the streets to a cottage. They all went in, and the
first thing she knew, Tina was lying on a soft bed,
feeling, oh, so sleepy. And in a moment more
she forgot everything.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>FLOWER CHILDREN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Wake up! wake up!” was the first thing she
heard. She raised herself on one elbow, and
looked about her.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the floor lay the fan, and staring up at her
from one of the slats was a face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I declare!” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, wake up! They are waiting for you,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>said the child, who now stood by the bed. “They
are all down stairs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina did not have time to say anything, but
picked up the fan and followed the child downstairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>They went into a room full of children; most of
them were sitting around the floor, and one seemed
to be telling the others a story.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Tina came in they made room for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Begin the story over again, Daffodil,” said
they, “so Eglantine can hear it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name isn’t Eglantine,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, it is,” said they. “That’s why you
are called Tina.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I don’t know your names,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’ll tell you,” said they, “before we
begin the story. Here are Violet, and Rose, and
Lily; Hyacinth, Johnny-jump-up, and Sweet William;
and Daffodil is going to tell us about little
Snow-drop.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Daffodil had lovely long, yellow hair. Violet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>was dressed in blue, Rose in pink, and Lily in
white. Hyacinth’s clothes were of different colors.
Johnny-jump-up was a pretty little fellow in purple
velvet jacket, and Sweet William wore dark red.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what is your name?” said Tina to the
child who had awaked her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Four-o’-clock,” said she, spreading out her red
and white striped frock. “That is why they sent
me up to call you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Shy little Violet nestled up to Daffodil, Rose
stood near her, tall Lily sat opposite, and Four-o’-clock
sat down by Hyacinth. Tina knelt down
between Rose and Sweet William, and Johnny-jump-up
stood behind Daffodil.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One day,” began Daffodil, “very early in the
spring, I chanced to be out for the first time. It
was quite cold; the snow was on the ground, and
I began to wish I had stayed in a while longer.
I looked about for some one to speak to, for I felt
lonely. I thought perhaps Hyacinth might be
out, but he wasn’t; and I knew it was too soon for
little Violet. I sat for some time looking about,
then I jumped down, and thought I would take a
walk.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
<img src='images/i_061.jpg' alt='[Girl]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“I went along through the snow. Oh, it was
so cold! I was really glad that every one was indoors.
Pretty soon I saw a little heap over in the
corner where the snow-drops live. I went over
there and brushed aside the snow, and there was a
dear little baby snow-drop. She was asleep, and
I was sorry I had brushed off her cover, for I knew
the frost would nip her, she was so young.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I couldn’t cover her up again very well, so I
picked her up in my arms and brought her to
a sunny spot. As soon as she was warmed
through, she opened her eyes and smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She stayed near me all that day, and was so
much company. But it was so cold that night that
she couldn’t stand it; so she was taken home before
I was, and when I got here she was waiting
for me.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How glad I was to see her, for none of you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>had come there, you know. But there is Bluebell
ringing for us. We must run to the school-room.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_063.jpg' alt='[Children]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>They all got up and ran out, taking Tina with
them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“We only have to go to look over our lessons
for to-morrow,” said Four-o’-clock, putting her
arm around Tina. “It will only be for half an
hour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina went with them into a large school-room,
and saw that there were different classes for them
all, though they all seemed to learn pretty much
the same thing.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a while Bluebell rang again, and they all
stood up waiting for their teachers, and in they came.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was Miss Sunshine, Miss Wind, and
Miss Rain. They all gathered around Miss Sunshine,
and some of them went out with her; but
two or three stayed behind to have their lessons
explained by Miss Wind and Miss Rain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is Snow-drop?” said Tina. “I have
not seen her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is so little and delicate she doesn’t often
come to school. She is with Eolus, Miss Wind’s
brother; he is so fond of music, and Snow-drop
loves to hear him play.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>They passed along through the garden, and
everywhere Miss Sunshine went it looked brighter.
She smiled down on Tina, and Tina blushed with
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>They went on into the house, and came to a
curtained doorway. As they drew near, Tina
heard music that sounded like the wind blowing
over harp-strings. It had a wild, sweet, wailing
sound, that almost made Tina cry. She pushed
aside the curtain and went into the room. A boy
was playing on a violoncello, and on the floor sat
the dearest little child, all in white.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That must be Snow-drop,” thought Tina, “and
she does look like one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you playing?” she asked the boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you hear?” he replied. “It is the
Wind’s Song.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I knew it sounded like the wind,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sit down and listen,” said he.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina sat down, and it seemed to her that the
wind was speaking, and this was what it said:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“How do you like it?” said Eolus.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
<img src='images/i_067.jpg' alt='[Children]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“Very much,” Tina replied. “Won’t you
please play something else?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He did so; and all the time he was playing
Tina thought of trickling water, lovely flowers, and
moonlight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was lovely,” she said, sighing, when he
had finished.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think so, too,” said Snow-drop. “Come,
take me to the dear Sunshine. I am tired.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You look pale,” said Tina; and taking her
by the hand, she led her out doors. The others
were running hither and thither, their bright
dresses making them look like bunches of flowers
at a little distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come play,” they called to Tina; and she
ran to join them, leaving Snow-drop with Miss
Sunshine.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let us play the ‘Wreath,’” they said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is that?” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you will see;” and in another moment
they were formed into a long chain.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Now, go see how we look,” they said to Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>She ran off a little way, and saw that they
looked like a wreath of flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>While she was looking, they all gathered around
Lily, and there was a big bouquet, with Lily in
the middle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t see how they do it,” thought Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now we are going to hide,” said they, “and
you must find us;” and in another moment they
were gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina looked all around for them, but not one
was to be seen. Instead, the garden was full of
blooming flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she passed by the different ones, they all
seemed to look knowingly at her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She ran about till she was quite warm and tired.
She stopped by a rosebush, and began to fan herself
with a big leaf; and what was her surprise to
find, while she was fanning, it turned into the same
fan she had used so often before.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>A MAGIC ROSE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Well, here you are again,” she said. “You
must have wings. I don’t see how else you could
get about as you do. I really am tired of you;”
and, giving the fan a fling, she threw it over the
wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! ha! You can’t get rid of me that way,”
said some one. “You’ll have to give me a rose
now.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“Who on earth is that?” said Tina. And a
little girl appeared on the other side of the wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you came out of the fan?” said
Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course,” said she. “You had no business
to throw the fan away; and now you will have
to give me a rose for it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina turned and took a rose from the bush by
her side. “What are you going to do with it?”
she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will see,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what they all say,” said Tina; “and I
should think I did see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The little girl laughed, and said: “I had better
not tell you what is coming, but you have been
with the Flower Children long enough;” and saying
this, she touched Tina with the rose, and in
another moment she was on the other side of the
wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ground was rough and stony, and hard to
walk upon.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“This isn’t a bit nice,” said she. “You might
have taken a better path.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t expect to have things always pleasant,”
said the little girl. “Remember, this is where
you threw the fan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina was silent, and went on stumbling over
the rocks.</p>

<p class='c008'>They soon came to a muddy ditch; the little
girl sprang over it, and stood on the other side waiting
for Tina; but although she tried and tried, she
could not get over it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What am I to do?” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say you are sorry you threw the fan over the
wall,” said the little girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sorry,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little girl leaned over and touched her with
the rose, and at once she was on the other side.</p>

<p class='c008'>They went on, picking their way through the
mud, till they came to a large hole in the side of a
hill. There was a heavy stone rolled up in front
of it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>
<img src='images/i_073.jpg' alt='[Dog]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>The little girl took the rose, and lightly tapped
with it, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Kitty-cat! Kitty-cat!</div>

      <div class='line in2'>You need have no fear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The heavy stone was rolled away, and they
went into what seemed a long, winding passage.
It grew darker and darker as they went on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take care,” said the little girl. “Here are
some steps.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went down two or three steps, and came
to a big stone door.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little girl touched it two or three times
with the rose, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Kitty-cat! Kitty-cat!</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>The door swung open, and they stepped into a
large room, or rather hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>On a big rug, in front of a door, lay a large
dog, with two or three kittens crawling over him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is Kitty-cat ready for us?” asked the little
girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said the big dog, in a gruff voice. “She
has just taken her nap.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can we go in?” said she.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Knock, and see,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little girl knocked with the rose, and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Kitty-cat! Kitty-cat!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Are you at home?</div>
      <div class='line'>Open the door, please,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And see who has come.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The door slowly opened—they went in. It
closed after them, and Tina saw that they were in
a large room. There seemed to be no one there
at first; but, on looking around, she saw a large
Maltese cat, sitting on a velvet cushion in front of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>the fire. She had a gold crown on her head, and
around her neck a fine collar embroidered with
pearls.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two girls went softly up to her. She waved
her paw toward a lounge on one side, and they sat
down.</p>

<p class='c008'>For some time nothing was said, and they all
sat looking at the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the cat turned her green eyes toward
Tina, and said, “So you couldn’t get over the
ditch?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you know?” said she.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do I know anything?” said the cat.
“Look in the fire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina looked, and saw the most wonderful
sights, just as if they were really there. All that
had just passed was plainly before her. She even
saw herself standing by the ditch, and waiting to
have the stone doors opened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is very strange,” she thought. Just then
the cat got up, stretched herself, and walked over
to where Tina was sitting. She jumped up on the
lounge and put her paw in Tina’s lap.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Tina looked around for the little girl, but she
was gone, and only the rose was lying where she
had been sitting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina picked up the rose, but the cat took it
from her, saying, “You must not have that till you
go. Now it is time for me to take another nap;
so you can go to your room.” And, holding the
rose in her paw, she gave Tina a tap with it, and
she at once found that she was in her own room at
home.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I am glad to get back,” she said. “I
wonder if everything is all right?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked about her for her toys. She only
saw a few of them, and at the same time she heard
something scratching and growling over by the
window. She ran quickly to see, and there found
a black cat wound up in her favorite toys, kicking
and scratching, and making a great fuss.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear!” she began to cry, “you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>ruined my things, you nasty, mean cat!” The cat
sat up on its hind legs, every hair bristling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you call me that!” it said. “What did
you do to the fan? Remember where you are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am in my own room,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you think so,” said the cat. “Well, perhaps
you will find out you are mistaken. It is my
room, I’ll have you to know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is,” said the cat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am going to tell my mamma,” sobbed Tina;
and she ran to the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the cat was there before her, and began
waltzing around on its hind legs, crying, “Where
is the rose? How are you going to get out without
the rose?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Tina found she could not get by the cat.
She made a rush at it and gave it a knock. Instantly
the room was full of cats. They snarled
and glared at Tina, so that she was frightened
nearly to death.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>She began to wring her hands and look for
some way to get out, but the cats were all around
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the midst of the noise and fuss, in came the
cat with the crown and collar. Two little white
kittens were holding up her tail; and another one
held a silver waiter, with the rose lying on it. A
large black cat brought up the rear with the velvet
cushion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is the matter?” asked the queen cat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then all the cats began to point at Tina, and
to talk at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>She stood there crying, hardly knowing what
to do, when a thought struck her, and she ran forward
and snatched the rose from the silver waiter.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an instant she was standing outside of the
stone castle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, where am I to go?” said she. “I
would like to get away from here as fast as I can.
I am afraid the cats will come after me.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
<img src='images/i_081.jpg' alt='[Horse]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>She looked around, and saw a stable. “I wonder
if there is a horse in there?” she said. “I
might get on his back, if there is, and get away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She went up to the door, and touched it with
the rose, but it did not open.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear! if I could only think of something
to say,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>She stood there looking at the rose, and lifted
it to her lips without thinking. As soon as she
had done it, she found herself saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Horse, horse, open the door,</div>
      <div class='line'>I never wished you so much before.</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Take me away,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Horsey, I pray,</div>
      <div class='line'>Horse, horse, open the door!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The door flew open, and there stood a horse.
Tina climbed up on his back, touched him with
the rose, and he trotted out. The door swung to,
and they set off down the road.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How glad I am to get out of there, and yet I
thought I was in my own room,” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“I wonder where the horse will take me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The horse pricked up his ears and jogged
along in a very sleepy sort of a way, and Tina began
to get sleepy too.</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt herself nodding, nodding, when all at
once the horse kicked up his heels, and over Tina
went, right into a snow-bank.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sat up rubbing her eyes, and looked around
for the horse, but he was nowhere in sight. The
rose too was gone, but there by her side was the
fan.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CLOUD COUNTRY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“You must have dropped from the clouds,”
said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is I?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look up, and you will see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina looked up, and saw nothing but a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>white cloud floating along. It came nearer and
nearer, and a voice said “Come!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina got up and ran along the road following
the little cloud, which seemed to be a few yards
ahead of her.</p>

<p class='c008'>They presently came to the edge of a wood.
The cloud suddenly disappeared, and Tina followed
a path that led into the wood. The snow
had all disappeared, and she saw ahead of her a
little spring bubbling out of a rock, and gurgling
along till it ran off a little happy brook.</p>

<p class='c008'>When she reached the spring she saw, seated
on a rock near by, a beautiful little creature in soft
fleecy white, that floated about her like a cloud.
She wore a scarf that looked like a rainbow; stars
twinkled in her hair, and in her hands she held a
bow like a new moon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You certainly must have come from the
clouds,” said Tina, “for I never saw anything like
you before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said she, “I did come from Cloud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Country, and I am going to take you back with
me. I am one of the little clouds, and my name is
‘Fleecy.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall like to go with you,” said Tina. “You
are so lovely.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Fleecy smiled, and, tying one end of her scarf
around Tina’s waist, she kissed her cheek, and they
rose up in the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was delightful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina felt herself wafted along, and felt as if
she could float that way forever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up, up they went, till trees looked like bushes,
and people like ants, and then they entered the
gates of Cloud Country.</p>

<p class='c008'>These were of pure white; and what a beautiful
sight Tina saw as they went in, and the gates
rolled together.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stretching to one side was a wide sea, as blue
as blue could be, the shores stretching out of
sight. Great rocks towered up all around.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other side rose up a gleaming palace.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>The doors were hung with purple and rose color,
and, as the curtains swayed, you caught sight of
the dazzling splendor inside.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_087.jpg' alt='[Children]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Over the palace a rainbow arched and dipped
down into the sea, where little white ships were sailing
about.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fleecy took Tina to the shore of the sea, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>she saw on the rocks several children looking out
on the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are they there for?” asked Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are stars,” said Fleecy, “and they are
waiting till it is time for them to come out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They don’t look like stars,” said Tina. “They
just look like any children. I thought stars must
be very beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some of them are,” said Fleecy, “but these
are quite ordinary. Those that attend the moon
are very beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is the moon?” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is in the palace,” said Fleecy. “She
will come out soon, then you can see her. Maybe
she will let you go with her to-night, as you are a
stranger here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What shall we do now?” asked Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we can slide down the rainbow, or rock in
one of the hammocks, or go sailing on the water.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am almost afraid to slide down the rainbow;
it goes right into the water.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Yes, but you go right through that; it won’t
hurt you. When we are in a hurry we go down
to earth that way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I would rather rock in a hammock.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well; come with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She took Tina farther away from the sea, and
in another moment she was lying on the softest,
rosiest cloud, with Fleecy by her side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When will the moon be out?” said she.
“Isn’t it nearly time?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Fleecy. “I see the lights over
in the palace now. They are bringing out the
chariot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We had better go,” she said to Tina, and
they got out of the hammock, and went and
stood by the palace steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very soon there was a rustle. It grew lighter
and lighter. Down the steps came first a beautiful
maiden bearing a lighted taper, that shone with
the fairest, purest light.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is Venus,” whispered Fleecy. “She is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the Evening Star now, and goes ahead of the
queen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then came a procession of other stars, and
next them the queen herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How fair and lovely she is!” said Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>She wore a dress of spun silver, and a crown
of diamonds on her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she passed along, Tina saw quantities of
figures on each side the steps, a long procession of
them that extended to the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Those are clouds,” whispered Fleecy, quietly.
“Stay here. I must go and take my place among
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina stood at the foot of the steps. As the
queen passed along, the crowd made way, and she
went through them until she came to Tina.</p>

<p class='c008'>She stopped and looked at her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are an earth child,” she said. “You
shall go with me in my chariot.” And, taking her
by the hand, she led her to a silver chariot that
was waiting just beyond.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Taking the taper from Venus, the queen got in,
and motioned Tina to follow.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_091.jpg' alt='[Tina]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>She did so, and
they rolled along toward
the sea, the
crowd scattering as
they passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chariot seemed
to have no wheels,
and when they reached
the blue water, it
slipped in and sailed
along as easily as a
boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tina looked over,
and saw that she
could look through
the water as easily as if there were nothing there.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole earth lay quiet before her. She
looked down and saw a maiden standing at a window,
looking out.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“She is unhappy,” said the queen; “and yet
I think she will be glad to see me.” And she
turned her face toward the windows where the
maiden stood.</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned and looked up at them, and a faint
smile came over her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was so still, that Tina heard her say distinctly,
“Oh, fair moon, you have driven away
the clouds from the sky. Perhaps there may come
some bright hope to drive away the clouds from
my life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went sailing on over the blue sea, till they
came to land again. They passed by huge masses
of gray rocks, and Tina saw ahead of them a pale
pink light.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The sun is coming,” said the moon. “We
must hurry home, or I will have to put out my
light.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They soon came in sight of the gleaming palace.
Fleecy came to meet them, and the queen
went in and left them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“Now,” said Fleecy, “we will go sailing on
the water; and when you get tired, you can just
slide down the rainbow to earth again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A quantity of little white ships were sailing
about. One floated up to them. They got in, and
sailed along with the rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>In every ship there was a little cloud. They
all smiled at Tina—sometimes sailing right along
by the ship she was in. They were all such happy
little clouds.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you always have such a good time?” asked
Tina of Fleecy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; sometimes the storms come,” she said,
“and they hurry us along, and whirl us about till
we hardly know which way to go, and fly as hard
as we can to get out of their way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Just then thunder was heard in the distance,
and Tina began to get frightened. “Oh, I wish I
were at home!” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked over the side of the ship, and saw
that they were directly over a lake on the earth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>There was a little boat on it, with some people
in it. One end of the rainbow seemed to go
down directly into the lake, and the people were
looking at it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will go right into the water,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no you won’t,” said Fleecy. “I will watch
to see that you get down safely.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Patter, patter, came big drops of rain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little ship sailed up to the rainbow, and
Tina got on it, holding on with both hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye,” called Fleecy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye,” she answered; and down she went
through the blue sea. Down—down, so swiftly!</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked back at Fleecy sitting in the boat,
and held on as hard as she could, hoping to be
saved from the cold water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down she went, and she shut her eyes hard
and knew she was lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now how sorry she was that she had left the
boat, and trusted herself to the rainbow.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>
<img src='images/i_095.jpg' alt='[Children]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“Oh, I shall be drowned!” she cried; and she
clung to the rainbow with all her might, but it felt
hard, like wood. She rubbed her eyes, looked
around, and saw that she was lying on the sofa, in
her own parlor at home, holding fast to the fan, surprised
to find that a heavy gust had come up, and
it was raining hard.</p>
